%description
It's a fork of seq24 (which is a fork of the original seq24),
but with a greater emphasis on song editing (as opposed to live looping)
and some enhancements. seq24 is great for sequence editing and live looping,
but I found it cumbersome to edit songs as the number of sequences
grew (I would quickly reach a point where there were more sequence rows
in the song editor than would fit on my screen without scrolling, which
made it difficult to keep track of the whole song).
