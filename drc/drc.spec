%description
Welcome to the home page of DRC.
DRC is a program used to generate correction filters for acoustic compensation of HiFi
and audio systems in general, including listening room compensation.
DRC generates just the FIR correction filters, which can be used with a real time or
offline convolver to provide real time or offline correction. DRC doesn't provide
convolution features, and provides only some simplified, although really accurate,
measuring tools.
For further informations see the documentation section, which includes the full manual
of the current version of DRC and a complete set of measurements showing the effect of
the DRC correction in a real life situation.
DRC is available for free and is released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. See the documentation for details.
