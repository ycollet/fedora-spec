%description
Infamous Plugins is a collection of open-source LV2 plugins.
It hopefully helps fill some holes, supplying non-existing plugins for linux audio.
There is little interest in creating ANOTHER compressor, or ANOTHER EQ when myriad
other excellent lv2 versions of such already exist. At least until I become
interested in making one of those things and feel I can do something different...
